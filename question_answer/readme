This is project use the perl regular expression to simulate an question& answer systme

The main process: 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. analyze the question type
		what/how question
		did/do/is question
	2. define the matching rules using regular expression
	3. parse the user question using the defined rules
	4. search the targeted text using the parsed rules

File description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	question_answer.pl: source code
	training_text: the text used to learn the rules
	test_text:  the answer text used to answer the question
	question_example: the question examples

Programming language
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	perl

QA system operation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	CMD mode:
		perl question_answer.pl training_text # need type the question
		perl question_answer.pl training_text < question_example # same as File mode
	File mode:
		perl question_answer.pl training_text question_example
		perl question_answer.pl test_text question_example

System design & implementation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. Two type questions supported:
		What/how type: the answer is a exact number.
		Did type: the answer is a trend: rise or fall
			Trend 0: Fall or not
			Trend 1: Rise or not
			Trend 2: Fall or Rise
	2. Main work flow
		a. define the parse rules for:
			company names
			verbs
			question types
			trends
		b. read question from STDIN or File handlers
		c. foreach question:
			read answer-file by line
			match the line with predefined regular expression
			identify the question type first
			check every possible solution
		d. return all the possible answers
		e. or tell user no available information
		f. answer the next question
	3. Key features
		I. regular expression
		II. improve the efficency by pruning the candidate space
			e.g. if a line without company name, skip it without further match
			     if a line without number, skip the what/how question
		III. only REG, no NLP tools

Special feature or limitation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Friendly user interactive design
	Fuzzy question recognition
	The what/how type question takes 1 or 2 minutes
